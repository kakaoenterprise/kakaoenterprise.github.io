# Abtract

In this paper, we focus on decomposing latent representations in generative adversarial networks or learned feature representations in deep autoencoders into semantically controllable factors in a semi-supervised manner, without modifying the original trained models. Particularly, we propose Factors Decomposer-Entangler Network (FDEN) that learns to decompose a latent representation into mutually independent factors. Given a latent representation, the proposed framework draws a set of interpretable factors, each aligned to independent factors of variations by minimizing their total correlation in an information-theoretic means. As a plug-in method, we have applied our proposed FDEN to the existing networks of Adversarially Learned Inference and Pioneer Network and performed computer vision tasks of image-to-image translation in semantic ways, e.g., changing styles while keeping the identity of a subject, and object classification in a few-shot learning scheme. We have also validated the effectiveness of the proposed method with various ablation studies in qualitative, quantitative, and statistical examination.
