# Abstract

Recently, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods are introduced and show impressive performance on many benchmarks.
Among those NAS studies, Neural Architecture Transformer (NAT) aims to adapt the given neural architecture to improve performance while maintaining computational costs.
However, NAT lacks reproducibility and it requires an additional architecture adaptation process before network weight training.
In this paper, we propose proxyless neural architecture adaptation that is reproducible and efficient.
Our method can be applied to both supervised learning and self-supervised learning.
The proposed method shows stable performance on various architectures.
Extensive reproducibility experiments on two datasets, i.e., CIFAR-10 and Tiny Imagenet, present that the proposed method definitely outperforms NAT and be applicable to other models and datasets.
